# NextGear Puzzlehunt 2017

Welcome to the NextGear Puzzlehunt. A puzzlehunt is like a scavenger hunt where you must solve puzzles to reach the next step.

This puzzlehunt is a race: the six dev teams (Keymasters, Try-Force, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Omega Team, Jedi, and Sith) are competing to see who can finish the race first. 

The first team to finish the puzzlehunt will receive a massive number (still to be determined) of spark points for each member. Any team that finishes before 5pm on Monday, August 14th will receive a small number of spark points each. Contractors will receive a gift card of comparative value. 

## Puzzles

In this repository, you will find six clues. Each of these clues will lead you to the location of a puzzle. Once you have found all six puzzles, then you should have the information required to find the seventh and final puzzle (which is hidden at http://www.imgur.com/L??????).

Once you have solved all six puzzles, you should be able to solve the seventh and final puzzle. Follow the instructions on the seventh puzzle to complete the puzzlehunt. 

## Rules

1. You may use any resource (excluding other teams)
2. You may go wherever you like
3. NO COOPERATION between teams is allowed. Each team must solve the puzzles completely on their own.
4. You may not obstruct any other teams from solving puzzles in any way. 

## Questions and Hints

If you have any questions, please see Steven Riche.

You will also have the opportunity to buy hints for any portion of the puzzlehunt. For your first hint, you will have 10 minutes added to your final time. For your second hint, you will have an additional 15 minutes added. Each further hint will add that many minutes plus 5. For example, if you get three hints, you will add 45 (10 + 15 + 20) minutes to your final time. 

When you buy a hint, Steven Riche will email your entire team the hint so you will all have a record of it.

## Happy Hunting!
